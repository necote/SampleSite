This is a sample academic website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages designed for our workshop. 

## Overview

The idea is to have this site as a reference/resource on GitHub for building your own site in the future. I have amended the standard Jekyll template by adding more Markdown to each file, and by adding more files and features to the site. This goal here was to try to include the kinds of things you might actually want on your site--for a more robust guide than is typically provided. For example, I've assumed that on an "About" page you might want your picture (with a caption and alt text), some text (maybe under a heading) and perhaps even a list (to display your many accomplishments)! 

Follow the instructions below to make your own site using this one as a model. And keep an eye out for the hints (ðŸ’¡) included throughout. 

## Basic Instructions

To view the Markdown files on GitHub to copy and work from (recommended): 

1. Go to [this folder](https://github.com/necote/SampleSite) on GitHub (which is where the code for this site lives!)
2. Click to open the particular Markdown file you want to view (for example, the one for this page is called `about.md`)
   - Note: you'll see that GitHub automatically displays these as a webpage, which is nice for reading, but not as helpful for copying the Markdown syntax, so:
3. At the top-right of the Markdown file you'll see a button called "Raw" -- click that
4. Then, you'll see the Markdown exactly as it was written to make the post/page on this site. This process should be helpful for guiding/inspiring your own design choices

ðŸ’¡Hint: the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) template only includes one page (`about.md`). To make additional pages, simply copy & paste that first one and change its filename. Inside, edit the title, permalink, and the text using Markdown. 

ðŸ’¡Hint: This specific page uses Markdown headings, links, numbered lists, line breaks, horizontal rules, and images. To see how it's done, follow the instructions above to view the Markdown.
