## GitHub Part II: Building a Static Website
### Friday, March 31st, 3:00-4:30 PM

This session is a follow-up from last semesterâ€™s intro to Git and Github. But, even if you didnâ€™t attend last time, you are still welcome to join! We will be learning some of the basics for building and hosting a simple website with GitHub and Jekyll. This is a great resource if you want a place to share your CV, teaching materials, or blog about your work in a free and low-frills way--where you retain control. This session begins with a short refresher followed by an applied introduction to getting started with making a static site. While we will be building on skills from the previous GitHub workshop, this session will aim to be beginner friendly and suitable for students and scholars in any discipline. Extra materials will be made available for those who need it. Prior knowledge of programming is not required. If you would like to follow along with the applied part of the workshop, there will be a few (free) tools to download before attending, a guide to which will be circulated to registrants ahead of time. This workshop will be held online with Zoom.

ðŸ’¡Hint: Posts are in the `_posts` folder. To add a new post, copy a previous post file and amend both the filename and its content. These posts, like pages, are written using Markdown. 

ðŸ’¡Hint: Jekyll requires a specific filename format for the blog post Markdown files: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`. Here `YEAR` is a four-digits (i.e. 2023), `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers (i.e. 03 or 10), and `title` is the title of the post. The `title` becomes part of the URL. See the URL for this post, for example. 

ðŸ’¡Hint: Posts are optional! Feel free to delete them.
