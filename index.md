This is a sample academic website using Jekyll and GitHub pages designed for our workshop. Navigate to different pages for hints and tips on creating your own static site. 

This project is inspired in part by Miriam Posner's notion of "[How Did They Make That](https://archive.org/details/howdidtheymakethat)," Amanda Visconti's *Programming Historian* [post](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages), and the official Jekyll [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). If you've ever looked at a scholar's website made with Jekyll and wondered how it's done--this workshop is for you!
