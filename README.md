# Materials for Building a Static Site Workshop

This is a repo for *GitHub Part II: Building a Static Website*: a workshop on making basic static sites with Jekyll and Github Pages, created by Nicole Cote, as part of the [GCDI](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) Spring 2023 workshop series. 

## Workshop Details

This session is a follow-up from last semester’s intro to Git and Github. But, even if you didn’t attend last time, you are still welcome to join! We will be learning some of the basics for building and hosting a simple website with GitHub and Jekyll. This is a great resource if you want a place to share your CV, teaching materials, or blog about your work in a free and low-frills way--where you retain control. This session begins with a short refresher followed by an applied introduction to getting started with making a static site. While we will be building on skills from the previous GitHub workshop, this session will aim to be beginner friendly and suitable for students and scholars in any discipline. Extra materials will be made available for those who need it. Prior knowledge of programming is not required. If you would like to follow along with the applied part of the workshop, there will be a few (free) tools to download before attending, a guide to which will be circulated to registrants ahead of time. 

This workshop was held online with Zoom on Friday, March 31st @ 3:00-4:30PM ET.

## Pre-Workshop Installation Guide
If you would like to follow along with these materials in an applied way you should first follow the below installation guide to ensure you have everything installed and set-up before proceeding. 

### Downloads Part 1 

If you attended last semester’s workshop you likely have the following already. If not, you'll need:   

- A text editor (i.e. the free [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) 
- A free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A basic sense of how to use GitHub with the Command Line. See [last semester’s workshop](https://github.com/necote/git-introduced) materials, if needed.   
  - Alternatively: download the free [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app and login with your GitHub account 
 
### Downloads Part 2 

New downloads (even for those who attended the workshop last semester): 

#### If you are on a Mac:
- Download [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from the Apple App Store (if you do not already have this app/if it isn’t up to date) 
- Then, actually open the app and accept the “Terms of Agreement.” That’s it.
- Note: This app is required for using the Command Line Tools that will be used in the below installation guide but, annoyingly, is not automatically installed on Mac. 

#### Everyone: 
- Complete Steps 1 & 2 *only* as explained under the "Instructions" section of the [Jekyll Quickstart Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) 
- Step 1 involves installing the prerequisites  
  - Choose the installation guide based on the kind of OS you have and follow all of the steps of that guide. I have a Mac, so I chose macOS and followed the steps exactly. 
  - Note: If you are on a Mac and would like a more detailed overview of installing Ruby you might check out [this blog post](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/#start-here-if-you-choose-the-long-and-manual-route). 
- Step 2 involves running just 1 line of code from the Command Line
