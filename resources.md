## Jekyll

There are many comprehensive guides on Jekyll. Here are a few recommendations:

- Jekyll's own [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) are particularly useful 
  - To get going, check out the [installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) which is OS specific 
  - And, to get inspired, refer to the [showcase](https://jekyllrb.com/showcase/) 
  - Ruby newbies might also want to read the [Ruby 101](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/) guide
  - Also provided are guides to the different kinds of site content, i.e. the [posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) and [pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/) guides will inform about those essential aspects of your site
- This site uses the default Minima theme. For more see theme's `README.md` on [GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Look to the branch for specific version of Minima you have (for more details see [this]({% post_url 2023-03-10-blog-reel-header %}) post). 
- The "Jekyll Beginner Tutorial Series" by [cloudcannon](https://cloudcannon.com/tutorials/jekyll-tutorial/) is another great resource
  - NOTE: I'd recommend this alongside the official Jekyll materials, but not in place of them. This is because Jekyll's own docs will always be reliably the most up-to-date
- If you need a detailed walkthrough tutorial, [this one](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) by Amanda Visconti on *Programming Historian* should be helpful
  - NOTE: as it states, some of this post is a bit outdated -- especially regarding downloads and also some aspects of publishing. To avoid potential confusion and heartache, it is strongly recommended that you refer to the official Jekyll documentation and resources listed above for more up-to-date download info. Refer to my slide deck for help with publishing.

### Themes

This site is made with the default Jekyll theme called [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Changing your theme is great next step for building skills and style ðŸ’…!  

- Looking for themes? There are a number of galleries out there with free and paid options. You might refer to this GitHub Pages specific [theme guide](https://jekyllthemes.io/github-pages-themes) as well as this comprehensive [listing](https://jekyll-themes.com/). This [list](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/free-jekyll-themes-for-2022/) of free themes by cloudcannon also has a number of great options.    
- And, there are a number of free themes suitable for academics. [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) is simple but clean. And, [academic pages](https://academicpages.github.io/) and [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) are designed specifically with the scholar profile in mind
- Free themes often have a repo on GitHub that instruct you how to install them
- Jekyll's [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) on themes is another good place to start for implementation
- GitHub's guide on ["Adding a Theme to Your GitHub Pages..."](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll) is also helpful  

## Markdown

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a great resource for learning the basics. The [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) page includes common formatting, and the [Extended Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) page includes topics such as emoji and tables
- Markdown has different kinds (basically, small style differences based on type--where some kinds allow for extra options). Jekyll's default is kramdown so their [Quick Reference](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) is also useful   

## GitHub

- GitHub's "[Setting Up A GitHub Pages Site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)" provides a detailed overview  
- For more help with GitHub and using Git generally, see GitHub's "[Git Guides](https://github.com/git-guides)"

- This workshop discussed the concept of "minimal computing." Read more [here](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/)
- A friendly reminder that the deck from our workshop is available online

ðŸ’¡Hint: the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) template only includes one page (`about.md`). To make this page, I simply copied that first page and change its filename. Inside, I edited the title, permalink, and the text using Markdown. 

ðŸ’¡Hint: This page uses Markdown headings, links, lists, line breaks, emoji, and horizontal rules. View the Markdown to see how it's done.
